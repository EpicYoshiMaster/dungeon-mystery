dungeon-mystery is a Typescript implementation of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky's dungeon algorithm.

This package is the main code behind [Pokémon Dungeoneer](https://github.com/EpicYoshiMaster/pokemon-dungeoneer), a web tool for generating and visualizing PMD layouts.

It's built to replicate the original algorithm as closely as possible, while also being much more readable and useful as a reference.

This package features:

- Fully commented functions with address references for the NA version of Explorers of Sky
- Complete map generation, returning all relevant data associated with the map as used in the game.

## Installation

npm install dungeon-mystery
